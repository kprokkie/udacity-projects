# ![Screenshot](favicon.ico) Restaurant Review App

## Overview
We incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. We took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Specification
We was provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website. This code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didnâ€™t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. Job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## How to run the project locally
To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer and follow the instructions below:

In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this. In a terminal, spin up the server with `py -m http.server 8000` and with your server running, visit the sit `http://localhost:8000` to see the live site or [Let's View Live Here !!](https://kprokkie.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app/)
