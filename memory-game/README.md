# ![Screenshot](favicon.ico) Matching Game

Build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).
The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

## How the Game Works ?

The game board consists of sixteen **cards** arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of **eight** different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

```
The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
```

> [Let's Play Live !!](https://kprokkie.github.io/memory-game/)

> On each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a seconad card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

```
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
```
